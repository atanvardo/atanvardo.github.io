# Lab protocol

## PCR

### DNA extractions

Clean the working surface with bleach.

Check the structure of the plate in the Excel file (in the tab "Plate design for PCR"). Every plate should include two blanks (negative controls) randomly distributed, and two samples duplicated at the end (last four wells).

For easiness and to avoid mistakes, put the extractions tubes in tube racks following the plate pattern.

Wait until they thaw, then centrifuge them (quick spin, 30-60 seconds at max speed).

Grab a plate, label it, and place it over a clean paper towel.

Mark the wells corresponding to the blanks with a pen, to avoid confussions.

Pipette 2 uL of each DNA extraction (briefly vortexed) to its corresponding well, following the plate pattern, marking each well after you have filled it to avoid mistakes. Do not open the extraction tubes over the plate!

### Primers

Take the pre-mixed primer plate corresponding to your PCR plate (it should be stated which one in the Excel file).

Wait until it thaws, then centrifuge it (quick spin, 30-60 seconds at max speed).

Place the primer plate next to the PCR plate.

Using the multichannel pipette, pour 4.5 uL of the primers to their corresponding wells. In the primer plate, keep open only the column that you are using, and cover it again as soon as you take the primers.

When you finish:
- If the volume left in the primer plate is low, ask somebody to refill the primer plate.
- If there are no more planned PCRs using that plate, remove the caps and seal it with foil in the thermic sealer for long storage.

### Polymerase

Take one of the tubes labelled as "MM" (master mix) from the polymerase box, and the tube of molecular water that should be around there.

Wait until it the MM tube thaws.

Add 105 uL of water to the MM tube and vortex it.

Using the dispenser, pour 8.3 uL to each well.

### Final steps

Close the plate using caps.

Vortex it.

Put it into the thermocycler. Choose the program "NGS COI", and check that nobody has modified it:

- 95ºC for 15:00
- 35 steps of
	- 94ºC for 0:30
	- 50ºC for 1:30
	- 72ºC for 1:30
- 72ºC for 10:00

Run it.
