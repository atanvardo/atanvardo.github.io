## PCR

### DNA extractions

Clean the working surface with bleach.

Check the structure of the plate in the Excel file (in the tab "Plate design for PCR"). Every plate should include two blanks (negative controls) randomly distributed, and two samples duplicated at the end (last four wells).

For easiness and to avoid mistakes, put the extractions tubes in tube racks following the plate pattern.

Wait until they thaw, then centrifuge them (quick spin, 30-60 seconds at max speed).

Grab a plate, label it, and place it over a clean paper towel.

Mark the wells corresponding to the blanks with a pen, to avoid confussions.

Pipette 2 uL of each DNA extraction (briefly vortexed) to its corresponding well, following the plate pattern, marking each well after you have filled it to avoid mistakes. Do not open the extraction tubes over the plate!

### Primers

Take the pre-mixed primer plate corresponding to your PCR plate (it should be stated which one in the Excel file).

Wait until it thaws, then centrifuge it (quick spin, 30-60 seconds at max speed).

Place the primer plate next to the PCR plate.

Using the multichannel pipette, pour 4.5 uL of the primers to their corresponding wells. In the primer plate, keep open only the column that you are using, and cover it again as soon as you take the primers.

When you finish:
- If the volume left in the primer plate is low, ask somebody to refill the primer plate.
- If there are no more planned PCRs using that plate, remove the caps and seal it with foil in the thermic sealer for long storage.

### Polymerase

Take one of the tubes labelled as "MM" (master mix) from the polymerase box, and the tube of molecular water that should be around there. *The MM tubes are in a box labelled "Qiagen polymerase master mix in the second drawer of the frezzer that is closest to the window. If there are only a few MM tubes left, tell someone to order more.*

Wait until it the MM tube thaws.

Add 105 uL of water to the MM tube and vortex it.

Using the dispenser, pour 8.3 uL to each well.

### Final steps

Close the plate using caps.

Vortex it.

Put it into the thermocycler. Choose the program "NGS COI", and check that nobody has modified it:

- 95ºC for 15:00
- 35 steps of
	- 94ºC for 0:30
	- 50ºC for 1:30
	- 72ºC for 1:30
- 72ºC for 10:00

Run it.

## Qubit

### Preparation

Prepare 96 Qubit tubes in 8 rows and 12 columns (like a plate). Label them in a way that you can easily identify them. Prepare 2 more tubes and label them as *1* and *2*.

In a big tube, pour 24 278 uL of Qubit buffer (= 25 pipettings of 971 ul). *It is kept in the fridge in the electrophoseris room, in a Qubit kit box. If you are using the last box, tell someone to order more.*

Add 122 uL of dye to the big tube. *The dye is on the cupboard above the electrophoresis bench. The dye should be kept in darkness, and outside the fridge or freezer. It comes with the Qubit kit; if you receive new Qubit kits, take the dye tube out before storing them in the fridge.*

Vortex the big tube.

Using the dispenser, add 199 uL of the mixture to each of the 96 Qubit tubes that you prepared earlier. Add 190 uL to the tubes *1* and *2*.

### Standards

Get the small bottles labelled as standard 1 and standard 2 from the Qubit kit box.

Add 10 uL of standard 1 to the tube *1*.

Add 10 uL of standard 2 to the tube *2*.

Briefly vortex both tubes.

### PCR products

Get your PCR plate ready. Centrifuge it (quick spin, 30-60 seconds at max speed).

Add 1 uL of the PCR product to the corresponding Qubit tubes. After pouring the PCR product, immediately close the Qubit tube and give it a brief spin.

Wait 5 minutes, you can clean the lab and store the reagents meanwhile.

### Measurements

Tap the screen of the Qubit to wake it up.

On the screen, choose the options to measure double strand DNA using the broad range kit.

If prompted, select that you are measuring 1 uL.

When the Qubit asks for the standard 1, put it inside, cover the lid, and click on the button to measure it.

Do the same with standard 2.

Then measure the samples one by one, anottating the measurement in a piece of paper.

If the measures do not make sense, re-scan the standards.

Transfer the measures to the Excel file, on the "Qubit and pooling" tab, on the left side (blue).

## Pooling

After writting the Qubit measures on the Excel file, the orange side will indicate how many uL from each PCR product must be added to the final pool.

Check it, because sometimes high measures (>100 ng/uL) are rounded down to 0, when it should be 1. Correct them manually if necessary.

Once you have the Qubit measurements for the 4 plates that belong to a pool, you can make it.

Prepare a 1.5 mL tube and label it. If the total expected volume of the pool is higher (you can see it in the Excel), find a larger tube.

Pour the calculated amount of each PCR product in the tube.

Vortex it.
