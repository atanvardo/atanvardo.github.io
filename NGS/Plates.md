# Plate design for the Sonata project

Our 24 tags are enough to amplify 576 samples (24 variants of the forward primer **x** 24 variants of the reverse primer) (6 plates). But, during the design of the experiment, we decided that each batch would be composed only by 384 samples (4 plates), by using a combination of 16 forward primers and 24 reverse primers. In each row we will add one of the variants of the F primer, and in each column a variant of the R primers:

| **Plate 1** | R1 | R2 | R3 | R4 | R5 | R6 | R7 | R8 | R9 | R10 | R11 | R12 |
| F1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F7 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| **Plate 4** | R13 | R14 | R15 | R16 | R17 | R18 | R19 | R20 | R21 | R22 | R23 | R24 |
| F9 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F10 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F11 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F12 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F13 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F14 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F15 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| F16 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

For example, the sample in the F2 well of the first (upper left) plate is amplified using the primers COIBF3_6 and COIBR2_2. The sample in the E4 well of the fourth (lower right) plate is amplified using the primers COIBF3_13 and COIBR2_16.

In each plate, the total number of samples is actually 92. We randomly choose two wells to leave them blank as negative controls (to detect contamination), and we choose two samples to be duplicated as a sequencing control (we expect to get the same sequence for each pair of duplicates at the end).
